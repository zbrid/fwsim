  TODO:
An interesting problem I ran into is that the current num
    of runs simulated can't all be held in memory at once, then run.

    That'll be interesting to solve. Maybe doing things lazily would be
    an easy solution in scala??
    * or run one at a time all the way through or run a few, print to a file, the run
    a few more
    * maybe I could implement each of those and have the strategy be pluggable and then
    test them all against each other
    * Note: I guess reading in all the data only works if the data is small enough to fit
    into memory. What's the max I can fit into mem? Whats the difference in size between
    a GameState and a data tuple? (I'm pretty sure I could figure that out.)
    * Would be nice to make a random file name per run so I don't have to worry about
    overwriting data by accident...

    OMG I TOTALLY FIGURED OUT A REALLY INTERESTING THING TO DO:

   I wonder if I could make the data spillover instead of always writing
   to file. Can I use spillover to make sure I don't hit heap limits. This is like
   what Spark does when you enable that option.

  * Would be good to do some testing to determine at what point I should write results
  to a file and when I can have everything in memory.
  * Can do some testing to see the speed of the different strategies as well.

    Beginning state
    8 info tokens
    3 fuse tokens
    Each player knows the cards of the others, but not their own
    3 players - each person gets five cards
    4 or 5 players - each person gets four cards
    Three moves
    Give info
      Can say X num of Y numbered cards
      Can say X num of Y colored cards
      Two choices - Can or cannot say you have zero of Y type of card
      Removes 1 info token for all above choices
    Discard a card and draw a new one
      Replenishes info token
    Play a card
      Choose a card from your hand an play it
        If can add to a firework display, add it
          If you completed a color, get an info token
        If can't add it, discard the card
          Lose a fuse token
        Always replace card by drawing

     If all fuse tokens are gone, lose immediately
     If all five cards have been played successfully, win immediately
     Otherwise, play until deck is empty and for one full round after that.
     At the end of the game, the values of the highest cards in each suit are added resulting in a total score out of 25 points.

     Variants
       Six suites instead of five
       More info tokens
       More bomb tokens
       Keep playing even when the deck is gone, game ends when a player would start a turn with no cards in hand
